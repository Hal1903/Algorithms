# Algorithms
Followings are just rough examples.

Binary Search: Can search a target data with logarithmic time complexity. With using hashmap together, it sometimes can find the minimum number that can complete a certain task under given time limitation (Refer to Koko eating banana problem on LeetCode).

DFS: Finding the shortest pathway to a target data or goal for not-deep or extremely deep data structure. Can do course scheduling under limited conditions.

BFS: Can do the same as DFS does, but for deep structure or not-wide structure. Exampleuses are counting how many grid coordinate can be visited with obstacles and how many islands are placed on a grid.

Union Find: Finding connections between data to another. Example uses are finding the longest consecutive number in an array and determining whether the given word can be re-ordered with given operations or not.

Kadane's algorithm: Finding the possible maximum summation value in a circular array.

Dynamic Programming (DP): Optimizing inefficient solutions. Knapsack problem and The Longest Common Subsequences are the most famous problems.

Topological Sort: Sorting by priority. Example uses are event scheduling and course registration.
